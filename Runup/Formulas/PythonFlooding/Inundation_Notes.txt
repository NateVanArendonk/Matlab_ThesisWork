STEPS FOR INUNDATION ANALYSIS
--------------------------------


USING NEW REGION ANALYSIS CODE
------------------------------
1) Run Inundation_RegionAnalysis.py -- See comments in script for description of input and output
2) Run createGDB_forSLR.py
    - This resamples the output of inundation analysis to 5 meters and reprojects to web mercator for the website
    - I usually ran all of the inundation analyses first, then batch processed multiple deltas with this script
3) Run 'reclassDepthGrids.py' 
    - This reclassifies the depth grids to 5 bins for the website




USING OLD CONNECTIVITY CODE:
---------------------------

1) Run 'SLR_Connectivity_Blocks_Batch_Feb13.py'
	- Will create ascii grids of inundation with water cells = 1 and dry cells = 0
	
2) Run 'Inundation_GridProcessing.py'
	- Will create a geodatabase for output
	- creates raster files from the Ascii Grid output from step 1
	- Calculates the depths in the inundated areas based on the DEM and the height of water level at each datum
	
3) Run createGDB_forSLR.py
    - This resamples the output of inundation analysis to 5 meters and reprojects to web mercator
4) Run 'reclassDepthGrids.py' 
    - This reclassifies the depth grids to 5 bins for the website
